# the_cult_of_weris_nsi_terminale
This is my final term project of NSI (a course subject in high school (I don't know if it exist in other countrys or what's the name of this course)), and it's a game, i got 20/20 at this project with two friends.

There is a little story and I used pytmx, pyscroll and pygame for coding this game. We spent a lot of time for doing this and we are a bit proud.
